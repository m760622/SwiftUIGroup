Group In SwiftUI | SwiftUI for beginners | 

Simple Demo of Group , How to use a group in iOS using SwiftUI

Here as a conclusion . I found 2 use cases where I can use group.
1.  you can only add up to 10 views to a Container View at a time if you want to add more than 10 views in a Container View , so you need to use group.
2.  If you want to apply same modifier to a multiple views , so in that situation you can use group . With the help of group you don’t need to apply same modifier to each view. Group applies them to every view individually, that inside a group. It help us to remove extra code .
3.   Any view modifier added to the Group component will apply to every child view separately.
 If you found any other use cases , so please share the use cases using comments on my youtubevideo.
